This file to be pasted into your github site at github cs50_practice_21 > Readme

This file is the first port of call when doing cs50 practice 21 so you know where you are overall. After all, it's easy to get lost!

You are currently updating your github basics file locally on Carl's laptop :Desktop git_cs50_practice_2021 > git_basics  (Same location as this file)
As normal, there should be a 'stopped here' location as your starting point.

A VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE
You have created a cs50_story file which offers a more comprehensive reference to your journey through coding and all it entails. Once you feel you have a decent mastery of something then it can be added to other files in a more susinct way.

So this has become your first port of call for now. 







Below to be checked at a later date.

For beginners who are overwhelemed with coding! Or someone who just wants a bit of practice.

My Simple Practice Tasks in C (Cs50x Harvard Course 2020)

This is a random selection of brief tasks I added to my repo whilst working through the Harvard CS50 introduction to computer science course 2020.

I'm not inventing anything here. I got the code mostly from the cs50 course and the broader internet. I have mostly isolated smaller sections of the code into easily digestible bite-size manageable sections.

So this is what I recomend. 
1) Open a file and read through the code and comments. 
2) Try to recreate the code without looking, testing it in the cs50 IDE.
3) Where you have made mistakes (and there will be many), make a note of them in a separate 'common error' file. (Read this every now and then to refresh your memory)

The 'common error' file is particularly useful if you paste the error massage alongside the fix you made. This has saved me many hours of working out a problem I had previously dealt with weeks or months ago that I had forgotten about.


So the goal is to be able to recreate the code in a blank file so you build up the brain muscle as you move forward onto more complex stuff. 

It's important you tackle things in small steps and give yourself lots of breaks.

When things go wrong (which is fairly common) Just remember that your brain is not a computer so don't be disapointed when it doesn't act like one.

If you become disolusioned because you are spendig such a long time on coding the 'simplest' of tasks, be aware that taking this time builds solid foundations.

Think of this exercise as building a menu of tools you can use for future coding jobs. The more time you spend understanding loops/arrrays/strings etc the more you can see which tool (or combination of tools) is best suited for the specific task.

Just to point out that there are times when I have added ALL the libraries (at the top) for every task, regardless of whether or not they are required. There is no particular reason for this other than laziness in not having to think about which functions come from which libraries. 
Yes, this is lazy and I plan over time to only introduce libraries as and when required. 

I am not a teacher. I created these tasks to improve my muscle memory and -as i said - develop a deeper understanding of how memory works, before working on more complex algorythms.

I believe that getting a solid grounding on the basic concepts of C, will help me better understand abstraction and really grasp the fact that when I type a line of code, a lot is happening under the hood related to C. This gets more exciting when delving into other higher level languages.

My code won't be perfect and I welcome feedback from others. (If I don't get feedback then how can I learn?)

My explanations may not be accurate but they have helped me to understand every step of the code.

I try, whenever I can, to run a program in main then run the same program as my own function. This isn't alwys straight forward and is well worth the practice. I am particularly thinking about the 'swap' task.

Anyway, I hope beginners have a go and find this useful.
