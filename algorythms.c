//Linear Search: Search each element in an array one at a time in a line.  aka an alogorythm ie: searching for the number 50
//for i from 0 to n-1
  //if the i'th element is 50, return true;  (The  bool)

//if not found: return false;



//Bineary Search Divide and conquer aka binary search

//if not in list
 //return false
 //if middle item is 50: return true
 //elsif 50 < middle element
 //Next, search left half
 //elsif 50 > middle element
 //search the right half

//The Chart
//Straight up refers to linear
//bend to the right is more logorythmic
  
  //n times steps  (linear)
  //n/2  steps (binary)
  
  //Moving away from search and now focussing on well designed algorythms
  
  //Big O italisized    aka in the order of
  
  //What is the efficiency of your algorythm (Your code)? You can give an approximation of this
  
  //Options:
//'Your algorythm is in the order of n, or on the order of n over 2 or on the order of log base2 n.
  
  //Since this is only an approximation, we can have :
  //'Your algorythm is in the order of n, or on the order of n, or on the order of log(n). (Throwing away 'n over 2' and log base 2)
  
  //A reason for getting rid of n over 2 and base2 is because as problems get bigger, n and n/2 get closer together, as does log(n) and log base2 n
