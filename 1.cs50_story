You are on the 2.basics file.

We can start by writing some simple c code here directly into main with notes.

Looking forward, Should we consider simplifying this repo into an easy look-up reference for C code?
For each strip of code we could consider different scenarios, something like:
1. Written directly into main
2. Written with an input and no output
3. Written as a function with an ouput but no input (if possible)
4. Written with both an input and output
5. Save the input into a variable.
You may well need to ammend the base code to adjust for these different scenarios.



###STOPPED HERE#####

Work through below, gradually moving and deleting as you go.



ONLY DO BELOW ONCE YOU HAVE CS50 LIBRARY WORKING ON CARL.
Currently you are on 2.Basics. It;s a case of tidying up these files and developing a deeper understanding of what's going on. 

You have cloned this repo to blue and carl. 

You worked through the cs50 git video as a refresher. The link is in the drive file.

So your next step should be to download the cs50 library so you can easily link it to your first.c file.


git clone https://github.com/cs50/libcs50.git





THE STEPS BELOW ARE SIMILAR TO WHATS IN YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE/AA TERMINAL FOLDER
BELOW CAN BE LOOKED THROUGH LATER. FOCUS FOR NOW ON THE DRIVE FILES FOR AUTHENTICATION AND COMMANDS
So now it's time to clone to local.
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
This was successful. All files on github are now on your local machine. 

STOPPED HERE
The next step is to make changes and push updates from local to github.

AND JUST BEAR IN MIND YOU NEED TO NOW BE WORKING ON THE NEWLY CLONED FILES AT DESKTOP/cs50x_practice_21


I'm getting chatgpt to help me with this, so below is the chat(named Change File Name). I will ask further questions as I go to help clarify anything. 

1.
So it is asking me to firstly 'stage' the changes I want to commit
git add .     I think the dot refers to staging ALL files.Otherwise you would simply name all the files you want to stage. 


These are extra questions I had. Try and implement them into the chat as you ask further clarifying questions.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Further question: What is 'staging' exactly and what does the dot refer to in git add .
Answer:
Staging allows you to selectively choose which changes(files) you want to include in your next commit. The staging area serves as a middle ground between your working directory (where you make changes) and your Git repository (where changes are committed).

# Stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories
git add .


Stage multiple specific files:
git add file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt


Stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories:
git add .


Stage changes in a specific directory:
git add path/to/directory/
Please note that this directory does not need to match a directory name on github. However, the filenames MUST match in order for the update to work.
You can also push files to github that have been created locally but don't yet exist on github. 
Her's how to do it:
Stage and Commit the new File:
As above, stage the new file using the git add command, and then commit your changes with a meaningful commit message, as follows:
git add newfile.txt


NOW IT'S TIME TO ACT.
STAGING
git add .
Ok so we're getting an error.     not a git repository   I'm guessing this means that I have simply created a local directory with files that match what's on my github. BUT THE LOCAL DIRECTORY IS NOT A GIT REPOSITORY.
So I think the best thing to do is paste local files into github files so they are all updated then pull the directory to a desired local location so I have the github repo saved locally. This will enable me to push updates of all files in future.  
In addition to this I have just added 1.git_story , 1.terminal_commands , basics and readme to the github repo cs50x_practice_21  (The official repo name on gitub) 

STOPPED HERE
So the next step is to pull the repo locally (all files) so you can begin working on them and easily updating then onto github as you go.


COMMITTING
git commit -m "write something meaninfull here"
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@


My username is moriss
My password might be G56i10T12@
Then it tells me to commit my changes
git commit -m "Type a message here"





Link your local repository to GitHub:



Below is a side note to add any Git repository to GitHub Desktop, even if it's not a GitHub repository.
NOt currently relevant but could be useful.
#######
I found the below resource to specifically help me 
Resource:https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop
You can add any Git repository to GitHub Desktop, even if it's not a GitHub repository.
#######



If you haven't linked your local repository to your GitHub repository, use the following command, replacing <your-username> and <repository-name> with your GitHub username and repository name: 

git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git



Push your changes to GitHub:
Finally, push your committed changes to GitHub:

git push -u origin master


If you are working on a branch other than master, replace "master" with the name of your branch.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository on GitHub. You may need to enter your GitHub username and password during the push process. If you prefer not to enter your password each time, consider using SSH keys for authentication.
