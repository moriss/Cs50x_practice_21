/*There is no such thing as a string.
  String is really just char *.
  
  char * x is a pointer, pointing to the address of the first byte of the string. 
  The null terminating character \0, indicates the end of the string.
  
  char *x effectively removes the cs50 training wheels (previously string) so the cs50 library is no longer required.
